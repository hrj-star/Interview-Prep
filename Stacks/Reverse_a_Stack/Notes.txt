Given a stack of integers , write a program to reverse the stack using recursion.



You are not allowed to use loop constructs like while, for, etc, Return st after reversing it using recursion. It is mandatory to reverse st using recursion.

Example 1
----------------------

Input: st = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]
Output:[4, 2, 3, 5, 1]
Explanation: After reversing the stack [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] becomes [4, 2, 3, 5, 1].
