LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) of three strings

Given 3 strings of all having length < 100,the task is to find the longest common sub-sequence in all three given sequences.

Examples: 
------------------------

Input : str1 = "geeks"  
        str2 = "geeksfor"  
        str3 = "geeksforgeeks"
Output : 5
Longest common subsequence is "geeks"
i.e., length = 5



Input : str1 = "abcd1e2"  
        str2 = "bc12ea"  
        str3 = "bd1ea"
Output : 3
Longest common subsequence is "b1e" 
i.e. length = 3.
