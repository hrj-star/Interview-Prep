Given a sequence of N positive or negative numbers, find a contiguous sub-array whose numbers have the largest sum.

Example: The Max 1D range sum of [−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4] is 6 resulting from the [−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4] sub-array.

arr[] = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}
Solution : 7
