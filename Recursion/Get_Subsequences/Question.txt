A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The elements may or mayh not be contiguous but need to be ordered .
At each step , we either include or exclude the element.
Eg : subsequences of abcd include {ac , bcd , bd} etc.

They are in order - 2 ^ n , where n is the length of original string.



Get all subsequences of a String in a ArrayList of String and return the ArrayList ?

Eg : str = "abc"

subsequences : ["", "a", "b", "ab", "c", "ac", "bc", "abc"]

2^n , if n = 3 , subsequences are : 8.
