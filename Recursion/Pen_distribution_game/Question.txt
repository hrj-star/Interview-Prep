Given an integer N denoting the number of boxes in a pen, and two players P1 and P2 playing a game of distributing N pens among themselves as per the following rules:

P1 makes the first move by taking 2X pens. (Initially, X = 0)
P2 takes 3X pens.
Value of X increases by 1 after each move.
P1 and P2 makes move alternatively.
If the current player has to take more pens than the number of pens remaining in the box, then they quit.
Game will be over when both the players quit or when the box becomes empty.


The task to print the following details once the game is over:

	The number of pens remaining in the box.
	The number of pens collected by P1.
	The number of pens collected by P2.



1)
Input: N = 22
Output:
Number of pens remaining in the box: 14
Number of pens collected by P1 : 5
Number of pens collected by P2 : 3

Explanation:
----------------------------

Move 1: X = 0, P1 takes 1 pen from the box. Therefore, N = 22 – 1 = 21.
Move 2: X = 1, P2 takes 3 pens from the box. Therefore, N = 21 – 3 = 18.
Move 3: X = 2, P1 takes 4 pens from the box. Therefore, N = 18 – 4 = 14.
Move 4: X = 3, P2 quits as 27 > 14.
Move 5: X = 4, P1 quits as 16 > 14.
Game Over! Both players have quit.


2) 
Input: N = 1
Output:
Number of pens remaining in the box : 0
Number of pens collected by P1 : 1
Number of pens collected by P2 : 0
