Given root of a binary tree and a key k in it, find distance of the given key from root. Dis­tance means num­ber of edges between two nodes.

Examples:

Input : k = 45,
        Root of below tree
        5
      /    \
    10      15
    / \    /  \
  20  25  30   35
       \
       45
Output : Distance = 3             
There are three edges on path
from root to 45.
For more understanding of question,
in above tree distance of 35 is two
and distance of 10 is 1.
