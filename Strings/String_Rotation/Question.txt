CTCI 1.9

https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string


Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another.

Given two strings s1 and s2 , write a code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to a isSubstring (e.g , "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
