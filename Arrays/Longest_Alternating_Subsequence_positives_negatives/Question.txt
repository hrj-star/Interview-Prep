Given an array arr[] of positive and negative numbers only. The task is to find the length of the longest alternating (means negative-positive-negative or positive-negative-positive) subsequence present in the array.


Examples:
--------------

Input: arr[] = {-4, 3, -5, 9, 10, 12, 2, -1}
Output: 5
Explanation:
The longest sequence is {-4, 3, -5, 9, -1} which of length 5. There can be many more subsequence of this length.

Input: arr[] = {10, 12, 2, -1}
Output: 2
Explanation:
The longest sequence is {10, -1} which is 2. There can be many more subsequence of this length.
